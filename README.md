Homework #6: Weather Dashboard

The goal of this project was to create a web application that allows the user enter a city name and find out its current weather conditions as well as a five-day forecast. 

I was able to get almost all the functions of this application working. The only major hangup was the left-hand column of city names. First I couldn't figure out a way to make the text clickable so I added buttons. Then I tried to get the buttons, upon a click event, to replace the text in the user input form. Unfortunately I couldn't get that to work by the deadline. I'll keep working on it!
